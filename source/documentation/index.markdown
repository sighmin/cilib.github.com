## CIlib Documentation:
CIlib is a library of different computational intelligence algorithms and supporting APIs,
targeting different paradigms (some are still in very active development). There is a busy
community around the project, which will gladly help where possible. If you find any errors,
post an issue for either the [documentation](http://github.com/cilib/cilib.github.com/issues)
or [source](http://github.com/cilib/cilib/issues).
Alternatively, fork and send us a pull request.
