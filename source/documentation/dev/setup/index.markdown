These are a few of the basic requirements needed to hack on CIlib. You should be
comfortable using these tools, any "extras" will be specific to your environment and
will not be discussed here.

## Before You Begin
1. [Install Git](http://git-scm.com)
2. Install a [Java JDK](http://java.sun.com) (version >= JDK7)
3. Install [SBT](http://scala-sbt.org)
4. Setup you development environments (editor / IDE, etc)
4. Clone the source code repository
6. Start hacking

__NB:__ It is recommended that you install these packages
using your systems dependency management system.
