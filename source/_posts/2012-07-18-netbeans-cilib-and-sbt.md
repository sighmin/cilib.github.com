This is a step-by-step guide to using Netbeans as your IDE for developing CIlib.
It is assumed that SBT 0.11.3, Scala 2.9.1 or later, and Netbeans 7.1 are installed
and that the latest CIlib source code has been retrieved.

<!-- more -->

### Step 1: Get the Netbeans Scala plugin

The nb-scala plugin is needed for Netbeans to work with Scala and SBT projects.
The following steps will install nb-scala:

- Download the correct version from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/erlybird/files/nb-scala/)
- Extract the compressed archive somewhere on your hard drive (remember the location)
- In Netbeans click on `Tools` -> `Plugins`
- At the top, click on the `Downloaded` tab
- Click the `Add Plugins...` button near the top
- Browse to the location (the one you had to remember) where the archive was extracted
- Select all the modules (Ctrl-click does the trick)
- Click the `Ok` button at the bottom
- Click the `Install` button near the bottom of the `Plugins` window
- Click `Next`, tick the `Accept` (only if you agree to the license) block then click `Update`
- If a validation warning appears it should be safe to click `Continue`
- At this point Netbeans will ask you to restart the IDE... please do so


### Step 2: Get the sbt-netbeans plugin

The sbt-netbeans plugin allows SBT projects wo be opened by Netbeans by generating
an Ant project using SBT commands. The following steps will install sbt-netbeans

- Open the global SBT plugins file usually situated at `~/.sbt/plugins/plugins.sbt`
(`~` is your home folder). If it does not exist create it.
- Add the following to the end of the file
        resolvers += ScalaToolsSnapshots

        resolvers += "remeniuk repo" at "http://remeniuk.github.com/maven"

        libraryDependencies += "org.netbeans" %% "sbt-netbeans-plugin" % "0.1.4"
    Note the empty lines between each line of text.
- Save the file


### Step 3: Set up the project

The following should be done in the terminal:

- Change to the directory CIlib is in, e.g. if it is in `~/src/cilib` then
        $ cd ~/src/cilib
- Run SBT
        $ sbt
- Run the netbeans command
        > netbeans
- Exit SBT
        > exit


### Step 4: Open the project in Netbeans

CIlib should now be ready to be opened by Netbeans.

- Open Netbeans
- Click `File` -> `Open Project...`
- Browse to the location that the CIlib folder is in e.g. if the CIlib source code
is in `~/src/cilib` then browse to `~/src`. The CIlib folder should have an icon
containing two red marks to the left of it.
- Select the CIlib folder and click `Open Project` near the bottom
- In the `Projects` view expand the cilib project and the `Libraries` folder
- Open the `cilib-library` and `simulator` sub-projects by double clicking on them

All the library code (algorithms, problems, etc) is in the `cilib-library` sub-project.

#### Done

Please report any errors found either on the CIlib github page or on IRC. If
there are people in the channel but are not responding leave a message anyway,
someone will eventually see it.
